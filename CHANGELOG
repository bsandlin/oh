1/15/2015 update:
* Correct regressions of validation and rendering behavior from pre-3/19/2020 version.

12/19/2020 update:
* Relax the pattern for MIC codes, to permit digits as well as uppercase letters.
* Add a footnote regarding the providedLiquidtyShr element to the technical guide.
* Enhance the pdfmake package in ./lib to support marked ("tagged") PDF-UA output.

10/27/2020 update:

* Correct bug which caused some text fields such as Venue names containing commas
  and periods to be truncated.
* Add missing customer and period information to the 606(b)(3) report header.

4/3/2020 update:
* for "PRV" brokers in samples/606b3_not_held_customer_handling, remove some numeric
  fields to illustrate that for the PRV business model the numbers are not required.

3/19/2020 update:
* relax the maximum length of venue, broker-dealer and customer names to 80 characters.
* relax the uniqueness constraint on venue name + mic combinations; now one venue name
  can have more than one MIC.
* alter the version element so that the new schema can continue to validate instances
  created using the previous schema version. 

2/26/2020 update:

* correct the documentation field of elements netFeeOrRebateCph, providedLiquidityNetCph 
  and removedLiquidityNetCph, so as to agree with the FAQ at
  https://www.sec.gov/tm/faq-rule-606-regulation-nms .  Schema validation
  is not affected, so the namespace and version remains the same.
  
* correct a bug in Rule606ReportGenerator.js causing truncation of Venue Names
  containing a "." anywhere other than as the last character.
